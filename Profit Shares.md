# Distribution
After all expenses have been paid, the remaining income will be split 50:50 into two accounts: investor profit and worker profit. The investors' profit is then to be allocated according to the end of last month's equity. Workers' profit is allocated according to shares. Workers are given a chance to elect specific roles and associated responsibilities. These roles may include provisions of up to one extra share. All roles and extra shares are to be re-elected monthly.
Both investors and workers can withhold earnings to be reinvested in the company. This reinvestment can be profit up to an amount, profit over an amount, or a fixed percentage. Reinvestments must be declared at least one week before the end of month.
