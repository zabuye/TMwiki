Once a week, every worker will submit a written summary. This report will include:
- Important tasks completed during the previous week
- Focus for the following week
- Tasks that have been handed off to others
- Any department metrics
- Estimated end of month financial metrics

While this report can be submitted any day of the week, live presentation with all workers is preferred. Consistency is more important than accuracy, as improvement will come with time.
